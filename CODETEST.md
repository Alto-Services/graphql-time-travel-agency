# Code Test Preparation

You'll be working on a GraphQL API for a travel booking agency. This is a hands-on pairing session where we'll implement core GraphQL functionality together. The test covers essential GraphQL concepts including queries, mutations, resolvers, authentication, data fetching, error handling, and performance optimization.

We'll provide you with a scaffolded Node.js/TypeScript codebase using Apollo Server, and a set of failing vitest tests that will require you to implement the missing functionality ranging from basic query implementations to n+1 query optimization. You are not required to complete every task - we want to see how you tackle them and your problem-solving approach.

Please ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed and are comfortable with TypeScript. Prior experience of implementing GraphQL is not mandatory but an awareness of the concepts will help. The session will be collaborative, so feel free to ask questions and discuss your approach as we work through the challenges.
