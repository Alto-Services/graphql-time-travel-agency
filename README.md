# ðŸš€ Getting Started

Welcome to ChronoQuest! This guide will help you navigate the codebase and understand what you need to implement.

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
- [ ] Run `pnpm start` to run the server and explore the Apollo Sandbox on [http://localhost:10101/](http://localhost:10101/)
- [ ] Run `pnpm test` to see current test status

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have `pnpm` installed, you can enable it using [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) (comes with Node.js 16.9+):
> ```bash
> corepack enable pnpm
> ```
> Or install it directly:
> ```bash
> npm install --global pnpm
> ```

## ðŸŽ¯ What You're Building

You're implementing a GraphQL API for a time-travel booking agency. The system handles:

- **Travelers**: People who want to travel through time
- **Bookings**: Time-travel reservations
- **Time Periods**: Historical destinations (Ancient Egypt, Medieval Europe, etc.)

## ðŸ§ª Test Guide

**Test File**: [src/tasks.spec.ts](src/tasks.spec.ts#L73)  
**Run Tests**: `pnpm test`  
**Goal**: Implement the missing functionality to make all tests pass  

### Tasks

1. **Query all travelers**
    - [x] âœ… Already implemented
2. **Query a traveler by ID**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Add a 'traveler' query that takes an 'id' parameter
3. **Get the traveler's name in all CAPs**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Implement resolver argument handling for the traveler query
4. **Creating a new booking returns nested traveler and timePeriod objects**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Implement field resolvers for the Booking type
5. **Get a traveler's bookings**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Implement resolver chains for the traveler's bookings
6. **Find why BookingError is not resolving**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Fix the union type resolution issue
7. **Implement the Person interface**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Resolve the Person interface to distinguish Traveler vs Guide
8. **Get bookings for an authenticated user**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Implement authentication and authorization for the bookings query
9. **Get departures from the EasyDeLorean API**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Implement resilient service to service communication to fulfill the departures query
10. **Optimize database calls for a booking**
    - [ ] ðŸ”§ Solve the n+1 problem for the booking query

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Read the schema first** - It tells you exactly what types and fields exist
2. **Look at existing implementations** - The working tests show patterns to follow
3. **Use TypeScript** - The type system will guide you to correct implementations
4. **Run tests frequently** - `pnpm test` will start vitest in watch mode so you can track your progress
5. **Don't overthink it** - Start simple and iterate

## ðŸ†˜ When You're Stuck

1. **Check the schema** - What fields/types are defined?
2. **Look at working examples** - How are similar resolvers implemented?
3. **Read test expectations** - What should the output look like?
4. **Use TypeScript errors** - They often point to the right solution
5. **Explore in the Apollo Sandbox** - `pnpm start` will run the [Apollo Sandbox](http://localhost:10101/) for interacting with your schema
6. **Encode your own tokens** - use the encoder at [jwt.io](https://www.jwt.io/) to help with testing authentication
