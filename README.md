## Story

Welcome to ChronoQuest: The Ultimate Time-Travel Agency!
In the year 2456, time travel is no longer a dream but a commercial reality. At ChronoQuest, we offer our elite clientele the ability to journey through history, witness legendary events, and experience life in ancient civilizations or futuristic worlds. As a backend engineer for ChronoQuest, your job is to ensure that our travelers’ adventures go smoothly by building and managing our in-house booking system.

You will interact with a range of colorful travelers—from future-born citizens to historical legends like Cleopatra herself—as they book trips to witness the pyramids being built or brave the Black Plague in Medieval Europe. Your role is to implement the GraphQL backend that handles their bookings, trip information, and real-time updates.

# What to do?
